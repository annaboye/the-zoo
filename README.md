## The Task

### For a passing grade:

Create a Single Page Application (SPA) using React with TypeScript.
The home page should display a list of animals with their names and a brief description.
Users should be able to click on an animal to view more information about it on a separate route.
On the animal's individual page, there should be a button labeled "Feed Animal" that allows users to mark the animal as fed. Once clicked, the button should indicate that the animal has been fed, and it should be disabled.
You should also include the timestamp of when the animal was last fed.

### For a higher grade:

When revisiting an animal's page, check if it has been more than three hours since it was last fed. If so, reset the feeding status, allowing the user to feed the animal again.
Additionally, display a notification on both the home page and the animal's page if it has been more than four hours since the animal was last fed, indicating that the animal needs to be fed.
